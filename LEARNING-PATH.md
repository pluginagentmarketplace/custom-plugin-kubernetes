# Learning Path Design

## Overview

This document explains how the Developer Roadmap AI Guide structures learning paths and recommends progression for learners.

## Learning Path Components

### 1. Career Path Selection

Users choose from 65 different career paths organized into 10 categories:

- **Web Development** (11 paths)

### 2. Level Assessment

Each learner starts at one of three levels:

- **Beginner**: No prior knowledge, starting from fundamentals
- **Intermediate**: Basic understanding, building depth
- **Advanced**: Significant experience, specialization focus

### 3. Learning Phases

Each path is divided into 4 phases:

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
  - Core concepts
  - Fundamentals
  - Basic tools

Phase 2: Core Skills (Weeks 5-12)
  - Practical application
  - Real-world scenarios
  - Tool mastery

Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Weeks 13-16)
  - Specialized knowledge
  - Best practices
  - Advanced patterns

Phase 4: Real-World Projects (Weeks 17-24)
  - Portfolio projects
  - Real implementation
  - Mastery demonstration
```
